# ADR 012: Playbook-Based Policy Engine

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-01-15

## Context

When a detector reports an attack, prefixd needs to decide: what action to take (police or discard), what rate limit to apply, what TTL to set, and whether to escalate if the attack persists.

These decisions could be:
1. **Hardcoded** -- Simple but inflexible, every change requires a code deploy
2. **Rule-engine** -- Powerful but complex (Drools, OPA), steep learning curve for network engineers
3. **Playbook-based** -- YAML config files that map attack vectors to response steps, familiar to anyone who's used Ansible

Network engineers write YAML configs daily (router configs, automation playbooks). A YAML-based policy system meets them where they are.

## Decision

Policy is defined in `playbooks.yaml` as a list of playbooks. Each playbook matches an attack vector and defines ordered response steps with escalation thresholds:

```yaml
playbooks:
  - name: udp_flood
    match:
      vector: udp_flood
    steps:
      - action: police
        rate_bps: 10000000
        ttl_seconds: 120
      - action: discard
        ttl_seconds: 300
        require_confidence_at_least: 0.8
```

Playbooks are hot-reloadable via `POST /v1/config/reload` or `prefixdctl reload` without restarting the daemon.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Network engineers can define policy without writing code
- Hot-reload means policy changes don't require downtime
- Escalation logic is declarative (confidence thresholds, step ordering)
- Easy to audit: `git diff playbooks.yaml` shows exactly what changed
- Playbooks can be version-controlled alongside router configs

**Negative:**
- YAML is error-prone (indentation, type coercion) -- mitigated by validation at load time
- Complex logic (time-of-day rules, customer-specific overrides) would need YAML extensions
- No playbook dependency graph or composition -- each playbook is independent
- Hot-reload doesn't validate against running state (a bad playbook could affect active mitigations on next event)

**Future:**
- Customer-specific playbook overrides (via inventory.yaml)
- Time-based rules (different thresholds during maintenance windows)
- Playbook editor in the dashboard UI (Phase 2 on roadmap)
